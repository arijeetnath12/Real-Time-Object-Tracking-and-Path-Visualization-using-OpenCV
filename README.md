# Real-Time-Object-Tracking-and-Path-Visualization-using-OpenCV
Implemented real-time object tracking with OpenCV and C++ that is capable of tracking and drawing the path of an object of interest. In this particular case, a blue pen is traced, but it can be modified to identify objects of any color and contour.
